        <p>
          ReactJS is a simple, feature rich, component based JavaScript UI
          library. It can be used to develop small applications as well as big,
          complex applications. ReactJS provides minimal and solid feature set
          to kick-start a web application. React community compliments React
          library by providing large set of ready-made components to develop web
          application in a record time. React community also provides advanced
          concept like state management, routing, etc., on top of the React
          library.
        </p>
        <h4>Benefits</h4>
        <p>Few benefits of using <em>React library</em> are as follows :</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Easy to learn</li>
          <li>Easy to adept in modern as well as legacy application</li>
          <li>Faster way to code a functionality</li>
          <li>Availability of large number of ready-made component</li>
          <li>Large and active community</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Toolchain -->
      <section class="main-section" id="Toolchain">
        <header>Toolchain</header>
        <p>
          To develop lightweight features such as form validation, model dialog,
          etc., React library can be directly included into the web application
          through content delivery network (CDN). It is similar to using jQuery
          library in a web application. For moderate to big application, it is
          advised to write the application as multiple files and then use
          bundler such as webpack, parcel, rollup, etc., to compile and bundle
          the application before deploying the code.
        </p>
        <p>
          React toolchain helps to create, build, run and deploy the React
          application. React toolchain basically provides a starter project
          template with all necessary code to bootstrap the application.
        </p>
        <p>Some of the popular toolchain to develop React applications are :</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Create React App : SPA oriented toolchain</li>
          <li>Next.js : server-side rendering oriented toolchain</li>
          <li>Gatsby : Static content oriented toolchain</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          React library is built on a solid foundation. It is simple, flexible
          and extensible. As we learned earlier, React is a library to create
          user interface in a web application. React’s primary purpose is to
          enable the developer to create user interface using pure JavaScript.
          Normally, every user interface library introduces a new template
          language (which we need to learn) to design the user interface and
          provides an option to write logic, either inside the template or
          separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of introducing new template language, React introduces three
          simple concepts as given below:
        </p>
        <h4>React elements</h4>
        <p>
          JavaScript representation of HTML DOM. React provides an API,
          <strong><em>React.createElement</em></strong> to create React Element.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="JSX">
        <header>JSX</header>
        <p>
          A JavaScript extension to design user interface. JSX is an XML based,
          extensible language supporting HTML syntax with little modification.
          JSX can be compiled to React Elements and used to create user
          interface.
        </p>
        <h4>React component</h4>
        <p>
          React component is the primary building block of the React
          application. It uses React elements and JSX to design its user
          interface. React component is basically a JavaScript class (extends
          the React.component class) or pure JavaScript function. React
          component has properties, state management, life cycle and event
          handler. React component can be able to do simple as well as advanced
          logic.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Expressions">
        <header>Expressions</header>
        <p>
          JSX supports expression in pure JavaScript syntax. Expression has to
          be enclosed inside the curly braces, { }. Expression can contain all
          variables available in the context, where the JSX is defined. Let us
          create simple JSX with expression.
        </p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <code
          >var cTime = new Date().toTimeString(); ReactDOM.render( The current
          time is {cTime} , document.getElementById('react-app') );</code
        >
        <h4>Output</h4>
        <p>
          Here, cTime used in the JSX using expression. The output of the above
          code is as follows,
        </p>
        <code>The Current time is 21:19:56 GMT+0530(India Standard Time)</code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
        <header>Functions</header>
        <p>
          JSX supports user defined JavaScript function. Function usage is
          similar to expression. Let us create a simple function and use it
          inside JSX.
        </p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <code>
          var cTime = new Date().toTimeString(); ReactDOM.render( The current
          time is {cTime}, document.getElementById('react-app')
        </code>
        <h4>Output</h4>
        <p>
          Here, getCurrentTime() is used get the current time and the output is
          similar as specified below :
        </p>
        <code>The Current time is 21:19:56 GMT+0530(India Standard Time)</code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
        <header>Attributes</header>
        <p>
          JSX supports HTML like attributes. All HTML tags and its attributes
          are supported. Attributes has to be specified using camelCase
          convention (and it follows JavaScript DOM API) instead of normal HTML
          attribute name. For example, class attribute in HTML has to be defined
          as className.
        </p>

        <h4>Example</h4>
        <code>
          function getCurrentTime() {return new Date().toTimeString();}
          ReactDOM.render(The current time
          is>{getCurrentTime()},document.getElementById('react-app'));
        </code>
        <h4>Output</h4>
        <p>The output is as follows :</p>
        <code>
          The Current time is 22:36:55 GMT+0530(India Standard Time)
        </code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Component">
        <header>Component</header>
        <p>
          A React component represents a small chunk of user interface in a
          webpage. The primary job of a React component is to render its user
          interface and update it whenever its internal state is changed. In
          addition to rendering the UI, it manages the events belongs to its
          user interface. To summarize, React component provides below
          functionalities.
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Initial rendering of the user interface.</li>
          <li>Management and handling of events.</li>
          <li>
            Updating the user interface whenever the internal state is changed.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Styling">
        <header>Styling</header>
        <p>
          In general, React allows component to be styled using CSS class
          through className attribute. Since, the React JSX supports JavaScript
          expression, a lot of common CSS methodology can be used. Some of the
          top options are as follows :
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            <strong>CSS stylesheet</strong> − Normal CSS styles along
            with className
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Inline styling</strong> − CSS styles as JavaScript objects
            along with camelCase properties.
          </li>
          <li><strong>CSS Modules</strong> − Locally scoped CSS styles.</li>
          <li><strong>Styled component</strong> − Component level styles.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sass stylesheet</strong> − Supports Sass based CSS styles by
            converting the styles to normal css at build time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Post processing stylesheet</strong> − Supports Post
            processing styles by converting the styles to normal css at build
            time.
          </li>
        </ul>
